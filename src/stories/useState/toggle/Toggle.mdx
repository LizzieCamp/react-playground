# Toggle

This component represents a toggle button that switches between an "on" and "off" state when clicked. It utilizes the useState hook from React to manage its internal state.

The component maintains two state variables:

`state` `(boolean)`: Represents the current state of the toggle button. It is initially set to true.

`value` `(string)`: Represents the text displayed on the toggle button. It can be either "on" or "off" based on the state variable.

The `toggle` function is invoked when the button is clicked and is responsible for toggling the `state` variable and updating the `value` variable accordingly.

- If the `state` is `true` (indicating the button is in the "on" state), it sets the `state` to `false` and updates the `value` to "off".
- If the `state` is `false` (indicating the button is in the "off" state), it sets the `state` to `true` and updates the `value` to "on".
