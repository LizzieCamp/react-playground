# Counter

This component represents a simple counter application with two buttons: "Increase Count" and "Decrease Count," and a displayed count value.

The component maintains its state using the `useState` hook from React, initializing the state variable state with an initial value of 0.

When the "Increase Count" button is clicked, the increaseCount function is called, which updates the state variable by incrementing its current value by 1. Similarly, when the "Decrease Count" button is clicked, the decreaseCount function is called, which decrements the state variable by 1.

The updated value of the state variable is displayed inside an `<h1>` element in the component's JSX, allowing users to see the current count on the web page.
