# Quote

Uses the quoteable api from here: `https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable`

---

The component utilizes the useState hook to manage two state variables:

- `quote`: Represents the content of the fetched quote, initialized with the starting message "Starting message."

- `userInput`: A boolean flag that, when set to `true`, triggers the fetching of a new quote. It is reset to `false` after the quote is fetched.

---

The getList function uses `fetch` to make an asynchronous call to the Quotable API, specifically to the endpoint for a random quote. Upon a successful response, the quote content is extracted and stored in the `quote` state variable.

---

The `useEffect` hook is employed to conditionally fetch a new quote when the `userInput` state variable is set to `true`. This ensures that the component fetches a new quote only when triggered by user interaction.
