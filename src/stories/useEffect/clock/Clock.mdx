# Clock

The `Clock` component is a React component that displays the current date and time, updating it every second

---

`useState` Hook:

- The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the `curDate` state variable, which represents the current date and time.
- `useState(new Date())` initializes `curDate` with the current date and time.

---

`useEffect` Hook:

- `useEffect` sets up an interval to update the curDate state every second.
- The hook takes a function as its first argument, which contains the code to run the side effect. In this case, it calls the `tick` function, which updates the `curDate` state with the current date and time.
- The empty dependency array ([]) ensures that the useEffect runs once after the initial render.

---

`clearInterval`:

- `setInterval` returns an interval ID (`intervalId`), which is used to identify and clear the interval.
- The `return` statement inside `useEffect` contains a cleanup function. This function is called when the component is unmounted or when the dependency array of `useEffect` changes.
- The cleanup function calls `clearInterval(intervalId)` to stop the interval and prevent memory leaks.
