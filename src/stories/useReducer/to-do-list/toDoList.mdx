# toDoList

The `toDoList` component is a React component that allows users to add items to a todoList

---

It defines a reducer function. Reducers in React are used to manage state changes based on dispatched actions. In this reducer:

- It initializes an empty array.
- If the dispatched action type is "add_todo_item", it creates a copy of the current state array, pushes the payload (todo item) into it, and returns the new array.
- If the action type is not recognized, it throws an error.
- It defines the toDoList component:

--- 

- Inside the component, it initializes a ref for an input element using useRef.
- This ref will be used to access the input field where users can enter new to-do items.
- It initializes the state using useReducer, passing the reducer function and an initial state of an empty array [].
- It renders a text input field and a button for adding new to-do items.
- When the button is clicked, it retrieves the value from the input field, dispatches an action with type "add_todo_item" and payload as the input value.
- It maps over the state array and renders each item as a list item.
